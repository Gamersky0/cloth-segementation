[[webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/cloth-segmentation)], [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05626)]

* `network-training` contains code for training the segmentation network.
* `clothgrasp` contains ROS code for executing grasps with the trained network.

See the README in each direction for installation and execution instructions.
